# Introduction
In this lab, we will build a new RESTful service that uses business rules to make a decision, and exposes it as a REST service. Then we will enhance the Quarkus microservice that we had already built to integrate with the DM REST API to provide a simpler approach to using the DM service. 


# Prerequisites

1. If you do not have a Red Hat developer account, go to https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/ and click on the Register link to create a developer account. 

2. We will be exploring some REST APIs - you can use curl on the command line to explore, but if you can install PostMan (https://www.getpostman.com/) on your local machine, that might make the exploration a bit easier and more visual
