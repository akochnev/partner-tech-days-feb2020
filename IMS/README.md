Infrastructure Migration Solution 1.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Red Hat infrastructure migration solution helps to break the cycle of expensive, long-term commitments inherent to proprietary infrastructure while delivering the necessary tools that can make the mass migration of workloads a snap. 

The solution includes point and click tooling that provides mass migration capabilities, special pricing, and standardized deployment patterns from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, and/or Red Hat Hyperconverged Infrastructure for Virtualization.
